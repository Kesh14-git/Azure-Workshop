# Azure Workshop
Day 1

*What is cloud computing? 

Cloud computing is the delivery of various computing services over the internet, including storage, processing power, databases, networking, software, and analytics. Instead of owning and maintaining physical servers or data centers, organizations can rent access to these services from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud.

Types:

a) IAAS-provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users manage servers and storage while the provider manages the underlying hardware. 

b) PAAS-offers a platform allowing developers to build, deploy and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. eg:Google app engine. 

c) SAAS-delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. 

d) on premises-refees to IT infrastructure and resources that are physically located within an organization's own facilities. 

*Physical infrastructure
They include data centers, servers, storage devices and networking equipment. 
Data centres-Azure contains data centres around the world but however the individual data centres aren't directly accessible. 
Azure organizes it's data centres into geographic regions. 
Region- is a well connected neighborhood with the broadee cloud city. Data privacy, speed, service availability are some important factors to consider when selecting a region. 
Availability zones-regions are subdivided into availability zones. They are separate data centers with same region. 

*Management infrastructure
Azure resources-component in azure tenant
Resource groups-organization of azure resources. 
Azure subscriptions-have control within your azure environment
Azure policies-restricts access based on role. 

*Sovereign regions
They are instances of Azure that are isolated from the main instance of azure and used for legal purposes. 
Some of the regions include US Dod central, US Gov Virginia
